# Machine Learning project

### Project data

Data:
* A Hybrid Intelligent System Framework for the Prediction of Heart Disease Using Machine Learning Algorithms
* Machine Learning Repository (Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems)

Code:
* If you want to test the code on different attributes you need to change the "arr" table in "SkratiAtributi" function. 
  There you enter the attributes that you want your model to learn. This is done so that we do not have too much split code.
